1. Make a stopwatch design with ms, sec, min, and hour 

2. use setInterval() to push numbers to each section, and if the section maxes out, 
change the next section. 
i.e. if seconds reaches 60, change seconds to 0 and add 1 to the minutes section. 



Maybe I can use setInterval() to do the counting for one of the stopwatches, and 

I can use a datetime function to do the counting for the other stopwatch. It 
may be a good way to show the inaccuracy of using setInterval
